    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kung pao chicken is Chinese-style stir-fried chicken cubes with dried chili peppers. It's a Sichuanese staple
        that was brought over to America and reinvented for local flavors and tastes. The Sichuanese version is a tad
        more complex, seasoned with Chinese peppercorns and a large heap of dried chili peppers. The American rendition
        stays true to most of the original ingredients, but the flavor profile is significantly sweeter and will
        sometimes include bell peppers.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>Soy sauce (or tamari)</li>
        <li>Vinegar (rice vinegar or sherry vinegar)</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>Red & green bell peppers</li>
        <li>Green onions</li>
        <li>Cashews</li>
        <li>Dried red chili peppers</li>
        <li>Fresh garlic & ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Kung Pao sauce: mix the soy sauce, vinegar and sugar in a bowl. (yeah, it's that simple.)</li>
        <li>Prep the chicken! Cut the boneless, skinless chicken breast into uniform strips. This is a little easier to
            do if your chicken is slightly frozen. Then, toss it in a little soy sauce and cornstarch to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the chicken until crispy! Working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, stir-fry the chicken
            pieces in sesame oil until they're cooked through and gorgeously crispy.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry! Stir-fry the bell peppers until they're a little soft. Then add the scallions, cashews, ginger,
            garlic, and dried chili peppers. Stir fry all of that for a minute or two, and then stir in the Kung Pao
            sauce and cooked chicken.</li>
        <li>Simmer. Let all of the flavors meld over the heat for a few more minutes. The Kung Pao sauce will thicken
            slightly and really coat the veggies and chicken, which is what you want.
        </li>
        <li>Serve! We love to serve this over steaming bowls of white or brown rice.</li>
    </ol>
